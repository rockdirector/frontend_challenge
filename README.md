# Frontend Challenge

This was indeed a challenge, primarily in trying to work with the quirks of the box model in the dimensions of a small device screen.

I continued with the look and feel of my last iteration of BusyBus, using the same typefaces and colours.

To retain the border structure from my Sketch mockup, I had to learn how to use pseudoclasses to create the border


- adding how best to do direction headings was complication

- ended up using an existing apple design pattern to add the structure for the direction headings

-Had to learn how to position the nav and tab bars with z-heights, add then add scrolling to only the bus-listings child section
